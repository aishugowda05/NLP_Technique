DESCRIPTION:

INTRODUCTION:
Sentiment analysis is a widely used Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that helps determine the emotional tone of text data. Businesses, researchers, and analysts leverage sentiment analysis to understand public opinion on products, services, and trending topics. By categorizing text into Positive, Neutral, and Negative sentiments, it provides valuable insights for decision-making.
A crucial step in sentiment analysis is visualizing sentiment distribution, which helps in identifying sentiment trends. Seaborn, a Python-based data visualization library, is commonly used for this purpose. However, newer versions of Seaborn have introduced a FutureWarning related to the improper use of the palette argument in countplot(), which needs to be resolved for better compatibility.

TOOLS:
The following Python libraries are used for sentiment distribution analysis:

Python: A versatile programming language for data science and visualization.
Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library for handling structured data.
Seaborn: A visualization library built on Matplotlib for statistical data visualization.
Matplotlib: A comprehensive plotting library for creating graphs and charts.
These tools help in loading, processing, analyzing, and visualizing sentiment data efficiently.

DATASET OVERVIEW:
The following Python libraries are used for sentiment distribution analysis:

Python: A versatile programming language for data science and visualization.
Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library for handling structured data.
Seaborn: A visualization library built on Matplotlib for statistical data visualization.
Matplotlib: A comprehensive plotting library for creating graphs and charts.
These tools help in loading, processing, analyzing, and visualizing sentiment data efficiently.

CONCLUSION:
Sentiment analysis provides valuable insights into public opinion, and visualizing sentiment distribution is crucial for better interpretation. Seabornâ€™s countplot() is an effective way to achieve this, but newer versions require correct usage of palette and hue arguments.

By implementing best practices, we ensure error-free, insightful, and future-proof sentiment analysis, helping businesses and researchers make data-driven decisions.
